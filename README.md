# Learn_word
An automatic way to learn word 

To use it, you need create a vocabulary .xlsx file and use each sheet as the different list of vocabulary.
Here I start with the list 7 so that you need to change the sheet offset.
The frist row is the title and the words will start from the second row and second column.
For more detail, you could see the vocabulary.xlsx file I uploaded.
